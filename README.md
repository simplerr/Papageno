# Utopian Engine

This project is developed to learn how renderers and game engines works as well as acting as a base for research/experimentation. The intention is to make my own games using it and also once more mature make it convenient for others to use as well.

It is written in C++ and uses Vulkan as the rendering API.

## Building

Currently the project only runs on Windows.

Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to checkout the required submodules.

Run `./generate_workspace.bat` script to generate a Visual Studio 2019 solution.
If you want to generate a solution for another VS version run `tools/premake5.exe` manually.

Pre compiled libraries for MSVC x64 Debug and Release are included in the `libs/` folder.
